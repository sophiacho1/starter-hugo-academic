abstract: In his July 2021 Executive Order, President Biden urged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) “to restore net neutrality rules undone by the prior administration.” Net neutrality, a term coined by Professor Tim Wu at Columbia Law School in 2002, is the network design principle that all traffic on the internet should be treated the same so that the users of a network, not the operator of the network, decide what the network is used for. The FCC’s approach to net neutrality, however, has swung back and forth as the partisan makeup of FCC leadership changes according to the presidential party. In this article, I delve into what net neutrality is, how the FCC has oscillated on net neutrality rules under different administrations in the past two decades, and how bipartisan Congressional legislation can bring this net neutrality pendulum to rest for the best interests of consumers, internet service providers, and the entire internet ecosystem.
