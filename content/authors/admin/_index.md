&#127891; I'm a rising junior at Harvard, where I major in Computer Science and Statistics and minor in Economics.

&#128202; My main interest lies in leveraging data to study topics at the intersection of technology, economics, and regulation. To that end, I'm excited to join the <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/org_rsg.html" target="_blank">New York Fed's Research & Statistics Group</a> this summer.

&#128640; I'm also active in the start-up space. I currently source and conduct industry research for <a href="https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/" target="_blank">Plug and Play</a>. Previously, I've worked at <a href="https://www.treasuredata.com/" target="_blank">Treasure Data</a> and <a href="https://www.elementai.com/" target="_blank">Element AI</a>.

&#9728;&#65039; In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello, listening to K-pop, and swimming.
