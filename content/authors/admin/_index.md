&#128218; I'm a rising junior at Harvard, where I major in <a href="https://www.seas.harvard.edu/computer-science/undergraduate-program" target="_blank">Computer Science</a> and <a href="https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/undergraduate" target="_blank">Statistics</a> and minor in <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/undergraduate" target="_blank">Economics</a>.

&#128200; I'm interested in the intersection of technology, economics, and public policy. I'm working for the <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/org_rsg.html" target="_blank">New York Fed's Research & Statistics Group</a> this summer.

&#128640; I'm also active in the start-up space. I source and conduct industry research for <a href="https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/" target="_blank">Plug and Play</a>. Previously, I've interned at <a href="https://www.treasuredata.com/" target="_blank">Treasure Data</a> and <a href="https://www.elementai.com/" target="_blank">Element AI</a>.

&#128187; I enjoy staying engaged with Harvard's CS community. On campus, I serve as a Head Teaching Fellow for <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/fall/" target="_blank">CS50</a> and <a href="https://csadvising.seas.harvard.edu/advising/pca/" target="_blank">Peer Concentration Advisor</a>.

&#127880; In my free time, you can find me playing the cello, listening to K-pop, or swimming.
