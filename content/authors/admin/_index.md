&#128218; I'm a rising junior at Harvard, where I major in Computer Science and Statistics and minor in Economics. 

&#128200; My main interest lies in leveraging data to study topics at the intersection of technology, economics, and regulation. To that end, I'm excited to be joining the Research and Statistics Group at the New York Fed this summer.

&#128640; I also like to keep myself involved in the start-up space. I'm currently sourcing and conducting industry research for Plug and Play. Previously, I've worked at Treasure Data and Element AI.

This coming fall, I'll be a Head Teaching Fellow for CS 50, Harvard's introductory computer science course.
