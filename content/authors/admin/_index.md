&#128218; I'm a rising junior at Harvard, where I major in Computer Science and Statistics and minor in Economics.

&#128200; My main interest lies in leveraging data to study topics at the intersection of technology, economics, and regulation. To that end, I'm excited to join the <a href="https://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/org_rsg.html" target="_blank">New York Fed's Research & Statistics Group</a> this summer.

&#128161; I'm also active in the start-up space. I currently source and conduct industry research for <a href="https://www.plugandplaytechcenter.com/" target="_blank">Plug and Play</a>. Previously, I've worked at <a href="https://www.treasuredata.com/" target="_blank">Treasure Data</a> and <a href="https://www.elementai.com/" target="_blank">Element AI</a>.

&#128187; I like to stay engaged with Harvard's CS community. On campus, I serve as a Head Teaching Fellow for <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2022/fall/" target="_blank">CS50</a> and as a Peer Concentration Advisor.

&#9728;&#65039; In my free time, I enjoy playing the cello, listening to K-pop, and swimming.
